<center><em>*You’ve probably heard of Zillow’s Zestimates—automated home value estimates—but how much do you really know about them? Here’s what you need to know about Zestimates.*</em></center>

One of the popular real estate website Zillow’s most attractive features is its Zestimate, which is an automated home valuation. This estimate is generated based on user-submitted data regarding the house in question as well as information derived from public records. To many people, this seems like a quick and easy way to figure out how much a property is worth.

But many may not realize that homeowners and their agents can go to the site and suggest that certain changes have been made to a property in order to alter their Zestimate. So how trustworthy are Zestimates, really? **Today, Mike Hege joins me to discuss what homebuyers and sellers need to understand when it comes to Zestimates.**
