*As a buyer in our Charlotte market, here’s how you can come out on top if you find yourself in a multiple-offer situation. *

If a listed home is priced well, move-in ready, and in a good location, more than one buyer will see the value in it, hence multiple-offer situations. We’re in a seller’s market here in Charlotte and our economy is strong, which means we’re seeing many bidding wars break out over available homes. As a buyer, how can you position yourself in the best way possible so that you win out in a multiple-offer situation and close on the home you want? Mike Hedge joins me today to answer that question by offering some valuable tips.&nbsp;
