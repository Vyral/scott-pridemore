*Although the coronavirus pandemic has interrupted and significantly changed our daily lives, we’re still doing our best to adapt to the situation and ensure our clients are safe and healthy.*

I hope you and your family are doing well and healthy. As our daily lives change during the coronavirus outbreak and subsequent shutdown, I want you to know how our team is adapting to keep servicing our clients while also keeping them safe and healthy. Given our Mecklenburg County order to stay at home, we’re doing a lot more things digitally these days. I look forward to sharing some of these exciting new things that we’re doing to help our clients in the wake of this global pandemic.
