When it comes to bringing extra value to today’s homebuyers, Realtor Mike Hege emphasizes the importance of giving honest feedback. **Agents shouldn’t pull any punches**; if the property the buyer is interested in needs major repairs, they should help their client understand why they shouldn’t buy the house. As a fiduciary and consultant to their clients, agents need to be upfront. At Pridemore Properties, Mike holds a buyer consultation where he walks the buyer through the process, shows them properties, and even shares the listing agent’s remarks.

A good agent also needs to help buyers understand that a home purchase is a process of elimination, not a process of selection. There is a difference between a buyer’s must-haves and their wants, and **our goal is to keep their options in a sort of funnel that begins with a wide array of options and eventually narrows down** to specific areas, homes, and property features/amenities.

Next, it’s important to remember that **buyers all want different things in a home**. Some want a house near the airport or interstate, others want a home with recreational outlets nearby, and some want to be closer to their family.

Also, consider the fact that **interest rates are currently at an all-time low.** This means it might be a good idea for a hesitant buyer to jump into the market; home affordability increases when interest rates are low.

If you’re considering a move in 2020, now is a good time to start having that conversation with a professional. Let’s familiarize you with the home buying process, the competition, the available inventory—the more information you have now, the more you’ll be armed with when the right property for you comes on the market.
