Here&rsquo;s how to successfully navigate our hot real estate market today.

 

A lot of sellers have questions regarding how they might be able to sell their home while also positioning themselves to successfully buy another property. 

In this COVID climate, we start by taking all the standard precautions that the CDC has imposed. We also allow homebuyers and agents to view homes one at a time while using facemasks and hand sanitizer.

“There is a huge opportunity for homebuyers to lock in a low interest rate.”

Homes aren’t taking long to sell at all. If you’re worried about selling too quickly and not being able to find a new home in time, we can help with that. We can connect buyers and sellers, align the times just right, and even lease the sold home back from the buyer for up to 60 days to find that new property if necessary. This gives our sellers a bit of a buffer and eases some of the stress that comes with buying in a low inventory market like this.

It’s not just about finding properties on the MLS if you’re a buyer. With record low inventory, you need to get creative. Good agents will be able to find properties that aren’t even listed. Sellers are earning top dollar right now, and most listings on the MLS are getting multiple offers.

At the same time, there’s also a huge opportunity for homebuyers to lock in a low interest rate. Statistics indicate that we’re headed into further reduced inventory based on current demand.

If you have any questions about buying a home, selling a home, or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Here&rsquo;s what buyers need to know about new construction homes.

 

As far as new construction goes, there is a litany of options in our marketplace, ranging across many price points and types of builds. What many don’t realize, though, is that a lot of these homes aren’t even in the MLS. Many times, a for-sale sign in the front yard will attract buyers to a new property before the first brick has even been laid. 

But what are the benefits of buying new construction? Here are just a few:

1. Everything is brand-new. You’ll be the first one to ever live in the home.

2. You can often customize the home, including paint colors and hardware.

3. Everything is under warranty.

“You’ll need a buyer’s agent to help you navigate the nuances of the builder’s contract.”

If you’re thinking of buying a new construction home, we highly recommend that you order a home inspection. Yes, the home is brand-new, but we’ve seen inspection reports come back with upwards of 50 items that need to be addressed prior to closing. It’s also critical to hire a buyer’s agent. Most builders will use contracts that contain inclusions and exclusions, and it’s our job as agents to make sure that the builder completes per the finish standards in the contract and that you, as a buyer, are cognizant of what you’re signing. 

We help buyers purchase new construction homes throughout Charlotte all the time, so if you have any questions or need any assistance, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help you, as well.

        <description>

As a buyer in our Charlotte market, here&rsquo;s how you can come out on top if you find yourself in a multiple-offer situation.

 

If a listed home is priced well, move-in ready, and in a good location, more than one buyer will see the value in it, hence multiple-offer situations. We’re in a seller’s market here in Charlotte and our economy is strong, which means we’re seeing many bidding wars break out over available homes. As a buyer, how can you position yourself in the best way possible so that you win out in a multiple-offer situation and close on the home you want? Mike Hege joins me today to answer that question by offering some valuable tips. 

Remember, if you have questions about this or any real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’m here to help.

You&rsquo;ve probably heard of Zillow&rsquo;s Zestimates&mdash;automated home value estimates&mdash;but how much do you really know about them? Here&rsquo;s what you need to know about Zestimates.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

One of Zillow’s most attractive features is its Zestimate, which is an automated home valuation. This estimate is generated based on user-submitted data regarding the house in question as well as information derived from public records. To many people, this seems like a quick and easy way to figure out how much a property is worth.

Many may not realize that homeowners and their agents can go to the site and suggest that certain changes have been made to a property in order to alter their Zestimate. So how trustworthy are Zestimates? Today, Mike Hege joins me to discuss what homebuyers and sellers need to understand when it comes to Zestimates.

Feel free to follow our discussion in the video above or use the timestamps below to navigate the video at your leisure:

1:25—How Zestimates are calculated and how they can be altered

2:45—Why, as people make changes to their homes, Zestimates become less relevant

5:00—Zestimates as a baseline

5:43—The appraisal process

7:41—How Zestimates ultimately fall short of true market value

9:04—Work with a real estate professional to help you avoid misinformation

If you have any questions about Zestimates or would like an accurate home valuation, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be happy to help you.

        <description>

When it comes to bringing extra value to today’s homebuyers, Realtor Mike Hege emphasizes the importance of giving honest feedback. Agents shouldn’t pull any punches; if the property the buyer is interested in needs major repairs, they should help their client understand why they shouldn’t buy the house. As a fiduciary and consultant to their clients, agents need to be upfront. At Pridemore Properties, Mike holds a buyer consultation where he walks the buyer through the process, shows them properties, and even shares the listing agent’s remarks.

A good agent also needs to help buyers understand that a home purchase is a process of elimination, not a process of selection. There is a difference between a buyer’s must-haves and their wants, and our goal is to keep their options in a sort of funnel that begins with a wide array of options and eventually narrows down to specific areas, homes, and property features/amenities.

“A home purchase is a process of elimination, not a process of selection.”

Next, it’s important to remember that buyers all want different things in a home. Some want a house near the airport or interstate, others want a home with recreational outlets nearby, and some want to be closer to their family.

Also, consider the fact that interest rates are currently at an all-time low. This means it might be a good idea for a hesitant buyer to jump into the market; home affordability increases when interest rates are low.

If you’re considering a move in 2020, now is a good time to start having that conversation with a professional. Let’s familiarize you with the home buying process, the competition, the available inventory—the more information you have now, the more you’ll be armed with when the right property for you comes on the market.

Don’t hesitate to reach out to us for help or any questions you have. We’d be glad to help you!

        <description>

The art of maximizing value is a broad topic in the real estate industry. It can refer to the value we agents bring to the marketplace, how we help maximize the value of sellers’ homes, the perceived value of investments for buyers, and so on. Today I’m joined by fellow agent Mike Hege to talk about how agents maximize value for their clients. 

Follow along in the video above to see our full discussion. For your convenience, I’ve provided timestamps so you can skip ahead to various sections:

If you have any questions for me about this topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
