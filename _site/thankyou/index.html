		            <p class="testimonial">Scott helped my husband and I buy our first home and I would highly recommend him to anyone in a heartbeat. He explained many things to us we did not know since it was our first time going through the process and made us feel at ease and we knew he would not let us make a bad decision. Scott created the perfect balance of letting us make our own assumptions about a house while also pointing out aspects of the house we didn't notice ourselves. Once we were into the negotiation process on the house we finally ended up purchasing, Scott stayed up into the late hours of a Friday night going back and forth because he knew how much we really loved the house. Even after negotiations were finished and we closed on our house, we would reach out to Scott to ask 'first time home buyer questions' and he always promptly responded. I will definitely be recommending Scott to any of our friends who want to buy/sell a house.</p>

His guidance and expertise were invaluable for us given that this was our first experience selling a home. We benefitted greatly from his connections to local contractors and also from his suggestions as to how to prepare our home to be sold. From there our home sold quickly at a price that we were happy to accept. I can't say enough about the Pridemore team and plan to recommend their services to anyone in the market to buy or sell a home.</p>

He has been the 'go-to realtor' for my mother, sister and myself for the purchase and/or sale of our homes. Scott is extremely knowledgeable about Charlotte properties, as well as being able to make all the other contacts necessary throughout the real estate transactions. During our most recent sale, I was out-of-town. There was no inconvenience, from my perspective, on dealing with the paperwork involved for the sale. I feel completely confident in recommending Scott to be your real estate representative.</p>

His knowledge of the area and professionalism far exceeded our expectations. From the beginning, Scott was very personable and made an effort to get to know us and what we wanted. He then made direct, clear recommendations but allowed us the freedom to explore within our agreed upon framework. He was always quick to respond and made the navigation of all the paperwork and inspections a seamless process. He has countless contacts and everyone he recommended to us has also been fantastic. Without a doubt, we would recommend Scott to anyone and plan on using him for any other real estate needs in the future. Thanks Scott!!</p>

We trusted him completely with every step of the way and is truly concerned with you being totally satisfied. There were several instances where I found a home that I really liked (thus closing the deal!) and he pointed out things that I would have overlooked or never considered. He continued to be consistent in his approach, and was always patient and honest, never pushing us on a property. I never ever felt pressure from him to buy, not once in the year he was working with us. My husband was also extremely impressed with Scott. When we finally found our dream home, we had signed the papers for submitting our offer. Scott mentioned a test we should conduct and have edited into the contract before submitting our offer. He didn't need to take this step but he did. I wholeheartedly recommend Scott and rave about him to anyone I know who is looking for a realtor. Without a doubt we will be utilizing Scott's services to sell our home.</p>

Turned out to be an excellent move to work with him to buy my house in Sedgefield!He really wants YOU to find what is right for YOU... will point out areas of concern or about which one would want more info prior to buying a house that a first-time buyer, such as myself, may not notice. I've come to learn that this would not be standard, but Scott is far better than standard!his local connections for vendors/contractors/etc have helped me to understand everything about what i need or want done, and they're local businessmen, not some dude at home depot. While I may not be quite as hard to impress as my father, Scott definitely gets 2 thumbs up, high 5's, and a big hug from me.</p>

		            <p class="testimonial">Scott is more than a realtor, he was an advocate for us every step of the way in the purchase of an investment property in Charlotte. Having little knowledge of the Charlotte area, Scott went above and beyond to help us get to know the city and all the information relevant to purchasing properties. He researched and viewed properties on our behalf since we live in a different state, and we had complete faith in his opinion. There was no point at which we felt he was pushy or put his own agenda before ours. Futhermore, he actively seeks out data and market research to keep us abreast of the Charlotte market. My husband and I both agreed that Scott does what so many brokers should do but do not. His personal touch is a refreshing contrast to so many other realtors who appear rushed to just get the job done. Scott acts with integrity, honesty and is a pleasure to work with, we can wholeheartedly recommend him.</p>
